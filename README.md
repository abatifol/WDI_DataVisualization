# üåç Interactive Dashboard for International Aid & Economic Development

## Project Overview

This project is part of the Data Visualization (2025) class in CentraleSup√©lec. It explores **SDG 1: No Poverty** and **SDG 17: Partnership for the goals** by visualizing the relationship between **economic growth**, **international aid flows** and poverty. Using data from the **World Bank** and **OECD**, we built an **interactive dashboard** that helps users understand how different countries and regions contribute to global poverty reduction through **Official Development Assistance (ODA)**.

It is built with **Streamlit**, **Altair**, and **Plotly** for dynamic visualizations.
